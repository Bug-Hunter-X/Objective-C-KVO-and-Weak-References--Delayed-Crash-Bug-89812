The solution involves explicitly checking if the weak reference is nil before accessing any of its properties. By adding a simple nil check, we prevent any attempts to access deallocated memory:

```objectivec
// bugSolution.m
@implementation MyObserver
- (void)observeValueForKeyPath:(NSString *)keyPath ofObject:(id)object change:(NSDictionary *)change context:(void *)context {
    if (object == nil) return; // Crucial nil check
    // ... access object's properties safely ...
}
@end
```
This addition prevents crashes and ensures the application runs smoothly.  Always thoroughly test your KVO implementations with weak references to avoid this subtle but potentially severe problem.
