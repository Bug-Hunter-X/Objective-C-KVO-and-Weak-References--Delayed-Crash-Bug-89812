# Objective-C KVO and Weak References: A Subtle Bug

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug that can occur in Objective-C when using Key-Value Observing (KVO) with weak references.  The bug is characterized by delayed crashes or unpredictable behavior, making it difficult to diagnose.

## The Problem

When an object is observed using a weak reference and that object is deallocated while the observer is still active, the weak reference will become nil. However, if the observer continues to attempt to access properties of the deallocated object through this now-nil weak reference, unexpected issues can result. The crash might not happen immediately, which makes debugging challenging.

## Reproducing the Bug

The `bug.m` file contains code that demonstrates this issue. Run the code and observe the erratic behavior or crash.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.m` file provides a solution to this problem.  Careful handling of the weak reference is crucial to prevent the delayed crash.  A robust solution must always check for nil before accessing the observed object.
