In Objective-C, a rare but perplexing issue can arise from the interaction of KVO (Key-Value Observing) and memory management, specifically when dealing with weak references.  If an object is observed using a weak reference and that object is deallocated while the observer is still active, a crash might not occur immediately but may manifest later in unpredictable ways.  This is because the observer might still attempt to access the deallocated object through the weak reference, leading to undefined behavior.
